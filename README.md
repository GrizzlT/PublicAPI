### Usage

You can use this API as a dependency via the public Hypixel maven repo.

```xml

<repository>
    <id>Hypixel</id>

### Dependencies
The Hypixel Public API Java implementation has the following dependencies:
* Google Gson library

### Query Limitations

The API server has a request limit of 120 queries per minute. Any abuse of the API or intentions to bypass this limit (
such as with multiple API keys) will lead to your API key being reset or banned.

If you require a higher limit than the above you can open a support ticket at https://support.hypixel.net and provide
your use case and why you require a higher limit.

### Obtaining an API Key

You can obtain an API key by joining ```mc.hypixel.net``` with a valid Minecraft account and running the /api command.
You will then be assigned a unique key that is to remain **private**.
